# Library for sliding object detection by C3-HLAC and subspace method.
#   works with Kinect and ni package
#   please rosmake openni_camera and openni_pcl

1. connect Kinect and "roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch" -- terminal 1
2. in another terminal,

     2.1 learn the environment  (necessary for only once)
         "bash `rospack find color_voxel_recognition`/demos/SH/learn_env.sh"
         - Enter for saving data, and "Ctrl+C" ONLY ONCE for quit

     2.2 learn objects (once for each object)
         "bash `rospack find color_voxel_recognition`/demos/SH/learn_obj.sh <object_name>"
         - Put the target object closest from Kinect and confirm the green box contains only the object.
         - Enter for saving data, and "Ctrl+C" ONLY ONCE for quit

     2.3 detect one object
         "bash `rospack find color_voxel_recognition`/demos/SH/detect_test.sh <object_name> <similarity_threshold> <bounding box size>"
