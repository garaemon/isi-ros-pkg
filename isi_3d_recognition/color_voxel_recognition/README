# Library for sliding object detection using C3-HLAC and linear subspace method.
#  This application works with Kinect and openni_kinect package (http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect)

1. connect Kinect and "roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch" -- terminal 1
2. in another terminal,

     2.1 learn the environment  (necessary for only once)
         "bash `rospack find color_voxel_recognition`/demos/SH/learn_env.sh"
         - Press "Enter" key for saving data, and "Ctrl+C" ONLY ONCE for quit

     2.2 learn objects (once for each object)
         "bash `rospack find color_voxel_recognition`/demos/SH/learn_obj.sh <object_name>"
         - Put the target object closest from Kinect and confirm the green box contains only the object.
         - Press "Enter" key for saving data, and "Ctrl+C" ONLY ONCE for quit

     2.3 detect one object
         "bash `rospack find color_voxel_recognition`/demos/SH/detect_test.sh <object_name> <similarity_threshold> <bounding_box_size>"
         - "similarity_threshold" should be between 0 and 1.
         - "bounding_box_size" should be given in metric unit.
